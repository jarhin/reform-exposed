The rules during an election are very clear, the source of every donation must be fully declared or the donation should be returned.\n\nFarage linked entities such as UKIP, the Brexit Campaign and the Brexit Party all tried to use methods to try and by-pass campaign funding rules leading to various actions being taken against them.\n\nReform UK can try to say that it's \"a smear\" but all of the evidence is publicly available. Perhaps their strategy is to ignore until after the election in the hope it doesn't create negative publicity during the election campaign.",

If she cannot prove this was her permanent residence then she can be removed from the electoral roll. If they do that, her candidacy will be voided and the election for Mayor will need to be re-run.\n\nhttps://t.co/LBCiUFn8TP\n\nThe matter has been referred to the police.\n\nShe needs to answer these questions on Friday:\n\n1) Was she was living at the address she gave on her nomination papers as her permanent residence?\n\n2) Do her mobile phone records to confirm where she was?\n\nIf she was living at the address given on her nomination papers her phone records will confirm that to the police.\n\nJenkyns can put an end to this right now, by releasing her phone records.\n\nSo we say - will you publish the records Andrea?",

So it’s obvious she was shopping around for somewhere to claim to be living…\n\nShe lives in Yorkshire, but has thrown money at the problem and rented somewhere to make it go away…\n\nThe hearing does not rule out an appeal or a police investigation in to the way she’s approached this.\n\nIf she wins tomorrow, it will hang over her Mayoralty.",

So it’s obvious she was shopping around for somewhere to claim to be living…\n\nShe lives in Yorkshire, but has thrown money at the problem and rented somewhere to make it go away…\n\nThe hearing does not rule out an appeal or a police investigation in to the way she’s approached this.\n\nIf she wins tomorrow, it will hang over her Mayoralty.",
